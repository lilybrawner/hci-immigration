Visable is an interactive system that was developed on this research question: "How might we reduce confusion and uncertainty for people navigating the U.S. immigration process?"

Visable is not intended to be a replacement for a qualified immigration attorney. All information we are presenting is publicly accessible from US government websites and other reliable sources. Our sources are cited at the bottom of each step, for each respective process. None of the personal information that you submit will be recorded in any way. This tool is not endorsed by UCLA. It is solely for a class project and is intended for informational purposes only.

Our project is entirely cloud-hosted on Google Cloud, so users can interact with the system without building it locally on their machine. The user interface for Visable was implemented using a React and Vite frontend, Express middleware, a Node.js runtime environment, and Google Cloud translation and text-to-speech APIs, and deployed by Docker using Github Actions. It is accessible through this link: https://visable-806871039898.us-central1.run.app/
